<h2>üöß Obstacles/What I Learned:</h2>
<p>My biggest hurdle in this project was relating the different states at various points in the calculation. In order to have a screen that shows the calculation result, and one that shows the calculation, I needed to juggle similar states at different points of time. Another thing that posed a challenge was storing the previous answer to continue calculations on that number. In creating an additional piece of state for userInput, I was able to manage what was shown on each screen, as well as continue the calculation.</p> <p>Finally, figuring out the correct regular expression to allow keyboard interaction for only a portion of the keyboard posed a challenge. With the help of <a href="https://www.regex101.com">regex101.com</a> and some if statements, I was able to target only the number keys and operations keys.</p>
